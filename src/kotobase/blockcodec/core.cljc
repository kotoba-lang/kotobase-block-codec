(ns kotobase.blockcodec.core
  "Deterministic compression frame for the bytes that go *inside* a kotobase
  block, above the CID and below the AEAD.

  ## Why the seam is here and nowhere else

  A kotobase block's CID is the sha2-256 of exactly the bytes handed to the
  block store (`ipld/put-node!`), and `ipld/get-verified-block` rehashes them
  on the way back. That fixes two things at once:

  - **Compressing below the CID is invisible and worthless.** The stored bytes
    are AEAD ciphertext (`kotobase-peer.core/put-tx-block!` encrypts the whole
    quad payload; `arrangement.core/index-root` encrypts each leaf value).
    Measured: random bytes deflate to ratio 1.003 — they *grow*. A provider
    that compressed its BLOBs would spend CPU to store more.
  - **Compressing above the CID changes the CID.** That is not a bug to work
    around, it is the constraint that makes this namespace's API shape
    inevitable: two writers that disagree by one byte produce two blocks,
    breaking dedup and `kotobase-engine-prolly`'s \"CID-identical to a full
    rebuild\" property.

  So the frame sits on the **plaintext payload, before `encrypt-fn`**, and

      frame  ::  bytes -> bytes

  is a *unary total pure function*. It takes no options — not a level, not a
  threshold, not an injected codec. Every knob is a constant of the format,
  because a knob is a way for two writers to disagree.

  This is deliberately the OPPOSITE of the injected-`encrypt-fn` discipline
  (ADR-2607051000), and the difference is exactly the CID: an AEAD's output is
  not required to be reproducible — that ADR chose a random nonce and said so —
  while this codec's output is *inside* the content address and must be
  byte-identical on every runtime, forever.

  Corollary, stated because it is the tempting mistake: **a host codec
  (`java.util.zip`, node `zlib`, `CompressionStream`) may not be substituted as
  a fast path.** DEFLATE output is not unique; a host encoder yields a valid
  stream with different bytes, hence a different CID, hence a silent fork of
  the block graph. `org-ietf-deflate` being portable `.cljc` is what makes one
  answer possible on JVM and Worker alike, and `golden-test` pins the bytes so
  an upstream change to its match heuristics fails the build instead of
  forking CIDs in production.

  ## The frame

      0x01 ++ <RFC 1950 zlib stream>   compressed
      0x00 ++ <payload>                identity, escaped
      <payload>                        identity, bare

  Identity is normally written **bare**, so a payload the codec cannot shrink
  is byte-identical to what the same writer produced before this namespace
  existed: enabling compression re-CIDs only the blocks it actually shrinks,
  and pre-existing history keeps its structural sharing. The `0x00` escape
  exists only for a payload that would otherwise start with a tag byte.

  `unframe` therefore assumes an untagged payload is legacy data. That is
  sound wherever the payload is DAG-CBOR node bytes — a node is a map, so its
  first byte is 0xA0–0xBB — and `legacy-safe?` is the assertion to run before
  wiring this into a seam whose payloads are something else.

  ## Byte conventions

  Arguments may be a JVM `byte[]` (signed), a JS `Uint8Array`, or a seq of
  unsigned bytes. Results are always a **vector of unsigned bytes (0–255)**,
  matching `org-ietf-deflate`. `platform-bytes` converts back to the
  `byte[]`/`Uint8Array` a crypto provider wants."
