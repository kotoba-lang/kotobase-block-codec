  "The same `.cljc` suite on ClojureScript. `org-ietf-deflate` is not resolved
   by nbb.edn, so point the classpath at a sibling checkout — this is the
   multi-dir `--classpath` pattern the workspace already uses:

     nbb --classpath \"src:test:../org-ietf-deflate/src\" run-tests.cljs

   Running it on a second runtime is the point, not a formality: the frame's
   bytes go inside a CID, so `frame` producing something different here than
   on the JVM would fork the block graph between a Worker and a JVM writer."
